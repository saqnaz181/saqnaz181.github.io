I am a Mechanical Engineering student with a strong foundation in calculus, physics, and engineering design. Passionate about motorsports and innovation, I thrive in hands-on environments where I can apply my skills in mechanical design, prototyping, and product development. With expertise in SolidWorks, AutoCAD, CATIA, and MATLAB, I enjoy tackling complex engineering challenges and pushing technological boundaries.  

Beyond academics, I was an active member of [LSU Tiger Racing Formula SAE](https://www.formulalsu.com/), where I contribute to high-performance vehicle design and engineering. I also serve on the board of my universityâ€™s Hiking Club, combining my love for the outdoors with leadership and team-building experiences. Additionally, my involvement in student organizations such as the Student Government Association and Student Programming Board has strengthened my ability to collaborate, organize events, and engage with diverse communities.  

With experience mentoring first-year students and working as an assistant teacher, I am passionate about helping others learn and grow. I am eager to gain hands-on experience in mechanical design and engineering to contribute to real-world solutions that drive innovation and improve lives.
